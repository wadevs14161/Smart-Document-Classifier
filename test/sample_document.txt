This is a sample document for testing the Smart Document Classifier system.

The document classification system is designed to:
1. Accept document uploads (TXT, PDF, DOCX)
2. Extract text content from the documents
3. Store document metadata in a SQLite database
4. Provide a RESTful API for document management
5. (Future) Classify documents using machine learning models

This sample document contains various types of content to test the text extraction functionality.

Key Features:
- Asynchronous processing using FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
- Support for multiple document formats
- Clean RESTful API design
- Built-in web interface for testing

The system is built with scalability and extensibility in mind, making it easy to integrate machine learning models for document classification in the future.
