# Smart Document Classifier Web Application

A full-stack web application for document upload, text extraction, and AI-powered classification using multiple state-of-the-art deep learning models with bulk processing capabilities.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Multi-Model AI Classification**: Choose between BART-Large-MNLI (407M parameters) and mDeBERTa-v3-Base (279M parameters) for zero-shot document classification
- **Bulk Upload Processing**: Upload up to 10 files simultaneously with concurrent processing
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Comprehensive analytics with charts showing document distribution, confidence scores, and upload trends
- **Document Support**: TXT, PDF, and DOCX files up to 25MB each
- **Deep Learning Powered**: PyTorch-based transformer neural networks for intelligent document understanding
- **Modern UI**: React TypeScript frontend with responsive design and drag-and-drop interface
- **RESTful API**: FastAPI backend with comprehensive error handling
