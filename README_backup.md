# Smart Document Classifier Web Application

A full-stack web application for document upload, text extraction, and AI-powered classification using multiple state-of-the-art deep learning models with bulk processing capabilities.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Zero-Shot Document Classification**: Classify documents instantly without any custom training. The application leverages powerful pretrained models to categorize documents into predefined categories.
- **Multiple Model Support**: Choose from two robust transformer-based models:
    - **BART-Large-MNLI** (407M parameters): Ideal for fast and accurate English document classification.
    - **mDeBERTa-v3-Base-MNLI-XNLI** (279M parameters): A multilingual model capable of classifying documents in over 100 languages.
- **Statistics Dashboard**: An intuitive dashboard to visualize and analyze classification outcomes and performance metrics.

## üìÑ Document Categories

The application is pre-configured to classify documents into the following categories:

- Technical Documentation
- Business Proposal
- Academic Paper
- Legal Document
- General Article
- Other

## ÔøΩÔ∏è Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, CSS3  
**Backend:** FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLite, PyTorch
