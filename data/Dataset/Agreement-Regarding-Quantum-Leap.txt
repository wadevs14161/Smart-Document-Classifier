AGREEMENT

Scope of Research Project. The Research Project shall focus on the development of a theoretical framework for exploiting hyper-entanglement to improve the fidelity and scalability of quantum computing systems. This includes, but is not limited to: (a) investigating novel entanglement generation techniques that are less susceptible to decoherence; (b) developing error correction protocols specifically tailored for hyper-entangled qubits; (c) creating simulation models to predict the performance of quantum algorithms implemented on hyper-entangled architectures; and (d) exploring potential applications of hyper-entangled quantum computers in fields such as drug discovery, materials science, and financial modeling. The Research Project shall be conducted in accordance with a detailed research plan to be mutually agreed upon by QuantumLeap and Researcher within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date of this Agreement (the "Research Plan"). Both parties understand that the nature of scientific research is iterative and that deviations from the initial Research Plan may be necessary or beneficial as the project progresses. Any significant modifications to the Research Plan shall be subject to written approval by both QuantumLeap and Researcher.

Term and Termination. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for a term of two (2) years (the "Term"), unless earlier terminated as provided herein. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon sixty (60) days written notice to the other party if the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within such sixty (60) day period. QuantumLeap may terminate this Agreement at any time upon thirty (30) days written notice to Researcher, subject to payment of all outstanding fees and reimbursement of expenses incurred by Researcher up to the date of termination, as outlined in Section 3. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Researcher shall promptly return to QuantumLeap all Confidential Information (as defined below) and all materials and equipment provided by QuantumLeap for the Research Project. The provisions of Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Compensation and Expenses. QuantumLeap shall pay Researcher a fixed fee of $250,000 per year for her services under this Agreement, payable in equal quarterly installments in advance. In addition, QuantumLeap shall reimburse Researcher for all reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in connection with the Research Project, including travel expenses, conference fees, and the cost of specialized software or hardware required for simulations or data analysis. All expenses shall be pre-approved by QuantumLeap and supported by appropriate documentation. QuantumLeap agrees to provide Researcher with access to its quantum computing hardware and software resources for the purpose of conducting simulations and testing theoretical models developed during the Research Project. The extent and duration of such access shall be determined based on the specific needs of the Research Project and shall be subject to availability. QuantumLeap further agrees to provide Researcher with reasonable technical support from its engineering team to assist with the use of its quantum computing resources.

Intellectual Property Ownership. All Inventions (as defined below) conceived, reduced to practice, or otherwise created by Researcher, QuantumLeap, or jointly by Researcher and QuantumLeap in connection with the Research Project shall be jointly owned by QuantumLeap and Researcher. For purposes of this Agreement, "Inventions" means any and all discoveries, inventions, improvements, processes, formulas, data, software, designs, and other intellectual property, whether or not patentable or copyrightable. QuantumLeap shall have the sole right to prepare, file, prosecute, and maintain patent applications covering the Inventions, at its own expense. QuantumLeap shall consult with Researcher regarding the preparation and prosecution of such patent applications and shall consider Researcher's input in good faith. Researcher hereby irrevocably assigns to QuantumLeap all of her right, title, and interest in and to any Inventions solely conceived or reduced to practice by QuantumLeap. QuantumLeap hereby irrevocably assigns to Researcher all of its right, title, and interest in and to any Inventions solely conceived or reduced to practice by Researcher. In the case of jointly owned Inventions, QuantumLeap shall have the exclusive right to commercialize such Inventions, subject to payment of royalties to Researcher as follows: QuantumLeap shall pay Researcher a royalty of five percent (5%) of Net Sales (as defined below) of products or services incorporating the jointly owned Inventions. "Net Sales" means the gross invoice price of such products or services, less discounts, returns, and allowances. Royalties shall be payable quarterly within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter. In the event that QuantumLeap licenses the jointly owned Inventions to a third party, QuantumLeap shall pay Researcher fifty percent (50%) of any royalties or other consideration received from such third party.

Confidential Information. Each party acknowledges that it may receive confidential and proprietary information from the other party in connection with the Research Project ("Confidential Information"). Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to, trade secrets, technical data, know-how, business plans, customer lists, and financial information. Each party agrees to hold the other party's Confidential Information in strict confidence and not to disclose such Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the disclosing party. The obligations of confidentiality shall not apply to information that (a) is already known to the receiving party prior to its disclosure by the disclosing party; (b) is or becomes publicly known through no fault of the receiving party; (c) is rightfully received by the receiving party from a third party without restriction; or (d) is required to be disclosed by law or legal process, provided that the receiving party gives the disclosing party prompt notice of such requirement and cooperates with the disclosing party in seeking a protective order or other appropriate remedy. Researcher specifically acknowledges that information regarding QuantumLeap's quantum computing hardware architecture and software algorithms constitutes Confidential Information and agrees to protect such information accordingly.

Publications. Researcher shall have the right to publish the results of the Research Project in academic journals and present such results at scientific conferences, subject to the following conditions: (a) Researcher shall provide QuantumLeap with a copy of any proposed publication or presentation at least thirty (30) days prior to submission or presentation; (b) QuantumLeap shall have the right to review such publication or presentation and to request the removal of any Confidential Information; and (c) QuantumLeap shall have the right to request a delay in publication or presentation for up to ninety (90) days in order to file patent applications covering any Inventions disclosed in the publication or presentation. Researcher agrees to acknowledge QuantumLeap's support of the Research Project in any publications or presentations resulting therefrom. Researcher also agrees to offer QuantumLeap the opportunity to co-author any publications resulting from the Research Project, where appropriate. The decision of whether or not to include QuantumLeap as a co-author shall be made jointly by Researcher and QuantumLeap, taking into account the level of contribution made by QuantumLeap's personnel.

Representations and Warranties. QuantumLeap represents and warrants that it has the full right, power, and authority to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder. Researcher represents and warrants that she has the expertise and experience necessary to perform the services contemplated by this Agreement and that she is not subject to any conflicting obligations that would prevent her from performing such services. Researcher further represents and warrants that she will conduct the Research Project in a professional and ethical manner and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Researcher makes no warranty, express or implied, regarding the success of the Research Project or the commercial viability of any Inventions resulting therefrom.
