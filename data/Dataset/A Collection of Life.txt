The dawn brings new light,
A chance to start fresh again,
Embrace all that is.

Gentle breeze whispers,
Secrets carried on the wind,
Nature's soft caress.

A single raindrop,
Reflecting the vast sky's hue,
Small piece of the whole.

Cracked pavement reveals,
A dandelion's bright face,
Hope in broken things.

The river flowing,
Carving paths through ancient stone,
Time's relentless hand.

A child's laughter rings,
Pure joy in a simple game,
Innocence shines bright.

The weight of sorrow,
A burden carried within,
Release and let go.

Sunset paints the sky,
Colors blending, fading fast,
Beauty's fleeting touch.

A star's distant gleam,
Guiding light through darkest night,
Find your way forward.

Life's tapestry weaves,
Joy and pain, love and loss knit,
A story unfolds.
