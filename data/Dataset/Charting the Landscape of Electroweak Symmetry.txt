Abstract: The discovery of a Higgs-like boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012 marked a pivotal moment in particle physics, confirming a crucial element of the Standard Model (SM). This paper delves into the subsequent decade of research focused on refining our understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and the role played by the Higgs boson. We present a comprehensive review of precision measurements of the Higgs boson's mass, spin, and parity, alongside its couplings to other SM particles, specifically focusing on deviations from SM predictions that could indicate new physics. We explore the evolving landscape of theoretical models beyond the SM that incorporate the Higgs boson, including supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and composite Higgs scenarios, assessing their viability in light of current experimental constraints. Furthermore, we address the persistent open questions regarding the Higgs potential, the stability of the electroweak vacuum, and the hierarchy problem, highlighting future directions for both theoretical and experimental investigations aimed at unraveling the deeper mysteries surrounding the Higgs boson and its implications for the fundamental laws of nature. This paper aims to provide a consolidated overview of the field, serving as a resource for researchers seeking to navigate the complexities of Higgs phenomenology in the post-discovery era.

1. Introduction

The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics has served as a remarkably successful framework for describing the fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions. However, the mechanism responsible for electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB), which endows elementary particles with mass, remained a significant puzzle until the discovery of a Higgs-like boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. This discovery, based on observations of its decay into various final states like photons, Z bosons, and W bosons, provided strong evidence for the existence of a scalar particle predicted by the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism. While the initial measurements confirmed the particle's mass to be around 125 GeV and indicated spin-0 and positive parity, consistent with the SM Higgs boson, many questions remained unanswered. The subsequent decade has been marked by intensive efforts to precisely measure the Higgs boson's properties, explore its couplings to other particles, and search for deviations from the SM predictions that could point to new physics beyond the SM. This research has not only confirmed the Higgs boson's role as a key player in EWSB but has also highlighted the limitations of the SM and motivated the development of numerous theoretical extensions that attempt to address its shortcomings.

2. Precision Measurements of Higgs Boson Properties

Following the discovery, a significant effort was dedicated to precisely measuring the Higgs boson's fundamental properties, including its mass, spin, parity, and decay widths. The mass of the Higgs boson has been determined with remarkable precision through combined measurements from the ATLAS and CMS experiments, utilizing various decay channels. These measurements have not only confirmed the consistency of the Higgs mass across different decay modes but have also provided crucial input for theoretical calculations aimed at understanding the stability of the electroweak vacuum. The spin and parity of the Higgs boson were also thoroughly investigated, with experimental data strongly favoring a spin-0, positive parity (CP-even) state, in accordance with the SM predictions. The decay widths of the Higgs boson into different SM particles, such as photons, Z bosons, W bosons, bottom quarks, tau leptons, and top quarks, have been measured with increasing precision. These measurements allow for the determination of the Higgs boson's couplings to these particles, providing a crucial test of the SM. Any significant deviation from the SM predicted couplings would serve as a compelling indication of new physics influencing the Higgs sector.

3. Exploring Higgs Couplings and Beyond the Standard Model

The strength of the Higgs boson's interactions with other particles, its couplings, are directly proportional to their masses in the Standard Model. This relationship is fundamental to the Higgs mechanism and the generation of mass. Experimentally verifying this proportionality has been a major focus of research at the LHC. Measurements of the Higgs boson's couplings to fermions, particularly heavy quarks like the top and bottom quarks, and leptons like the tau, are crucial for confirming the SM's mass generation mechanism. Any significant deviation from the predicted coupling strengths could indicate the presence of new particles that mix with the Higgs boson or modify its interactions. The absence of direct evidence for such particles has led to the development of more sophisticated theoretical models that can accommodate subtle deviations in the Higgs couplings while remaining consistent with experimental constraints. Such models often invoke new physics at higher energy scales, which manifest themselves as effective operators in the low-energy theory, modifying the Higgs couplings in a predictable way. The ongoing and future searches for rare Higgs decays, such as the decay into a Z boson and a photon, are also important for probing new physics that could contribute to these loop-induced processes. These searches provide a complementary approach to directly measuring the Higgs couplings and offer the potential to uncover subtle deviations from the SM predictions.

4. Theoretical Models and Future Directions

The SM, while successful, leaves several fundamental questions unanswered. These include the hierarchy problem, the origin of neutrino masses, the nature of dark matter, and the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The Higgs boson, as a fundamental scalar particle, is particularly susceptible to quantum corrections that can destabilize its mass, leading to the hierarchy problem. Several theoretical models have been proposed to address these issues, often involving new particles and interactions that modify the Higgs sector. Supersymmetry (SUSY) is one of the most well-studied extensions of the SM, predicting a symmetry between bosons and fermions, which can stabilize the Higgs mass and provide candidates for dark matter. Composite Higgs models propose that the Higgs boson is not a fundamental particle but rather a bound state of other particles, similar to the pions in QCD. Extra-dimensional models introduce additional spatial dimensions, which can alter the gravitational force and potentially solve the hierarchy problem. The current experimental data from the LHC has placed significant constraints on these models, ruling out many of the simplest versions. However, more sophisticated versions of these models, which can evade these constraints, are still viable and continue to be actively studied. Future directions for both theoretical and experimental research include exploring higher-energy colliders, such as a future circular collider (FCC), which could probe the Higgs sector with unprecedented precision and potentially discover new particles associated with EWSB. Furthermore, advances in detector technology and data analysis techniques will allow for more sensitive searches for rare Higgs decays and subtle deviations in the Higgs couplings, providing a more comprehensive picture of the Higgs boson and its role in the fundamental laws of nature.
