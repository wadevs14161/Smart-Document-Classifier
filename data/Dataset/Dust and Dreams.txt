From the shadowed alleyways of a forgotten metropolis, arose the unlikely tale of young Ant, a child of the dust and the dreams. His genesis was a silent affair, fatherless and framed by the grim realities of a world too young to understand. But fate, as it often does, penned a sudden twist into his narrative. A philosopher of advanced years, weary of a world that he seemed both to admire and detest in equal measure, discovered Ant amongst the ruins of a place that seemed abandoned by progress.

He adopted the child, and his mother, embracing them both into a fold that promised refuge and new prospects. Under this paternal mentorship, Ant blossomed like a resilient wildflower amidst a barren landscape. His mind, nimble and thirsty, absorbed wisdom like the parched earth drinking rain. He was taught the art of debate, and his master delighted in engaging with him in thoughtful contemplation. He acquired knowledge of science and nature that even the local academy could not attain. His imagination was the most exciting, for it carried him to strange realms that none before him could speak of.

Alas, as the heavens allow little rest for saints and even less for men of interest, death crept into Ant's sanctuary as cancer was to rob us all of this shining new life. His passing was like a dimming of light. A book unfinished and tragically curtailed. The tragedy lies not only in the extinguishing of potential, but in the theft of a mind on the precipice of untold greatness. Though young Ant is dead, stories of him live on. He who lived as a philosopher has inspired so many men of importance, his voice will echo forever throughout the land.

But what do I care for him now, let it not bring me despair.
